This folder contains a collection of MATLAB scripts with which 
to postprocess TopologyTracer2D3D output files. 

!! THEY VERY LIKELY DO NOT WORK NAIVELY OUT OF THE BOX !!

Rather they should serve as an orientation of how to setup a 
processing workflow but will require a close inspection. For 
compiling the paper it work out for me, and in fact, should not
be too difficult to follow. 

Essentially, my itention of sharing the scripts was to aid 
you in utilizing the TopologyTracer for which to give further
hands on with or fully detailed examples I hadn't had time to
work on. I would like to set these up! So far though,
there is an ample amount of work in other research fields which 
prevents me from doing so without funding. Therefore, help yourself 
squeeze the documentation, and if that does not help or you
feel lonely :) or in case of doubt feel free to write me an e-mail:
