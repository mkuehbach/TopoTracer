**Compile a growth history for individual grains**
==================================================

Consider the Matlab scripts in the *scripts/* folder.


**Please note that these scripts provide only the key functionalities to import TopologyTracer results data into MATLAB. Hence, they require adaptation to the analysis target desired.** 

These scripts are the originals I used for post-processing the long-range effects paper results:
