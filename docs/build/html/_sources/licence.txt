    TopologyTracer is an MPI-parallel datamining tool for the conducting of spatio-temporal 
    analyses of microstructural element dynamics. Its purpose is the quantification of correlations
    --- spatial and temporal --- between individual microstructural elements and their 
    higher-order neighboring elements. Specifically, its current functionalities allow to 
    study the volume evolution of individual grains over time and set their growth history into 
    relation to the evolution of the higher-order neighbors. The tool is unique insofar as it 
    allows processing these individual surveys in a parallelized manner. Thus, enabling the 
    post-processing of so far intractable large datasets.

    The source code was developed by Markus K端hbach during his PhD time with Luis A. Barrales-Mora 
    and G端nter Gottstein at the Institute of Physical Metallurgy and Metal Physics with RWTH Aachen University. 
    Being now with the Max-Planck-Institut fur Eisenforschung GmbH in Dusseldorf, I maintain the code, 
    though at disregular intervals. Nonetheless, feel free to utilize the tool, do not hesitate contacting 
    me for sharing thoughts, suggesting improvements, or reporting your experiences.
